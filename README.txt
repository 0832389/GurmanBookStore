Started at 4:02 PM on 2023/10/27.
Created a new project in .NET5.0 and named it GurmanBookStore and authenticated it for individual accounts.
I got my Area, Controllers and Data folders.
Then, i added README.txt file.
Then, opened the launchSettings.json file and commented the sslport.
Then, i checked my _ViewStart.cshtml file and it is okay.
After that, i checked my all the folders like HomeController.cs, ErrorViewModel.cs, _ViewImport.cshtml and _ViewStart.cshtml.
Then, i checked Startup.cs file and did changes as were described in the provided ppt.
After that, check the whole code in Startup.cs and it is okay.
Then, ran command "update-database", build started and build succeeded.
Then, i tested my application and it worked!!!!
Registered by email and setting password, it worked.
After that, i logged out and then logged in to check if it works properly.
It worked.
